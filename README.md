# CodingBat-Java
CodingBat exercises that I have completed.  These exercises have all be written in Java.
Below are the names of the exercies, including the description of each and possible outcomes.

# stringTimes
Given a string and a non-negative int n, return a larger string that is n copies of the original string.

stringTimes("Hi", 2) → "HiHi"
stringTimes("Hi", 3) → "HiHiHi"
stringTimes("Hi", 1) → "Hi"

# frontTimes
Given a string and a non-negative int n, we'll say that the front of the string is the first 3 chars, or whatever is there if the string is less than length 3. Return n copies of the front;

frontTimes("Chocolate", 2) → "ChoCho"
frontTimes("Chocolate", 3) → "ChoChoCho"
frontTimes("Abc", 3) → "AbcAbcAbc"

# makes10
Given 2 ints, a and b, return true if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.

makes10(9, 10) → true
makes10(9, 9) → false
makes10(1, 9) → true
